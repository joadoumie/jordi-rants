# Engineering Culture

## Post-mortem: a project that failed and what you learned
Honest retrospective on a project that didn't succeed. What went wrong, what you'd do differently, and lessons that apply broadly.

## Code review culture: what actually works vs cargo culting
Examine different code review practices. Separate effective practices from ritual. What actually improves code quality?

## The hidden costs of technical debt
Real examples of how technical debt compounds. Quantify the impact on velocity, reliability, and team morale. When is debt worth taking on?
